## Data science

Question: what is "Data Science" in your opinion?

* Creating nice visualisations of data
* Coding 
* Machine learning and creating predictive models
* All of the above

## In reality:

* Data science is about extracting meaningful information from unstructured data to make informed decisions

## How?

* To gain meaningful information from unstructured data you could possibly require:
** visualisations of your data
** predictive models

End goal is to obtain information to make better informed decisions

## So...

* Data science is a blend of disciplines 
* An adaptive, iterative and analytical process

## Example: Improving company performances:

Question: which students spend the most time on Instagram? How can we improve user efficiency and attention?

## Example continued: 

* Approach: aggregate top 5% of users based on use time and visualise activity to compare against remaining users

* Insight: these users spend a disproportionate amount of time uploading multiple images

* Action for company: allow for multiple images to be uploaded into one post to save time

## Data Science:

* Is about using data to gain IMPACT. End goal is IMPACT for the company, whether that be profits, users, etc.

## The Data Science methodology:

* Helps analysts to stay mindful of which phase of the analysis they are performing 

* Is an adaptive, iterative, phased process

* Will guide what we learn

## Methodology

## Why 

* The methodology will act as a template of steps in our project, the analysis of a Melbourne Housing Market data set

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* An approach/philosophy/mindset for data analysis 

* Utilises data visualisation to understand and summarise a dataset without prior assumptions

* Often overlooked or undervalued in the shadow of modelling
Crucial for developing optimal models which can be interpreted

## EDA

* Analysts often have a hypothesis they want the data to test
* For example: are properties near the CBD more expensive than those further away?

EDA is an approach which does not require such a hypothesis.
Approach is open minded and has no previous assumptions about the data. Focuses on allowing the data to reveal information itself

## Goals of EDA

* To gain insights into the data set 

## WTF is insight tho

* Uncovering of deeper understanding of the data 

* Gathered when exploring the subtleties of the data

* Knowledge that surpasses summary statistics and what numbers show

* Different for every dataset, and grows as you keep going

## Example

## Importing datasets

Download Melbourne dataset and use the following: 

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo = T}
df <- read.csv(file.choose(""))
```
