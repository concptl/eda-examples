## Role of data

Data is going to play huge roles in helping society progress

Will help solve many of the largest issues within society

* Environmental sustainability

* Ecological damage

## Overfitting in models

Say in a housing dataset there were two mansions that had doors with a green paint cover. 

A risk models have is overfitting
* So the model jumps to the conclusion that all houses with green doors are good houses

Not necessarily the case.

## Risks of data

With increase in data comes risks of overfitting, or disparate impact from predictions

* Especially applicable to health insurance, or ANY insurance!
