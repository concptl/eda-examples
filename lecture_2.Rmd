## Caveats of R

* Permissive language means writing quick code is easy.
* However, while robust sometimes not readable.

## Littering

```{r}
for (i in 1:10) {
    print(i)
}
```

## Lack of illogical error messages

```{r}
x <- list(firstName = "John", lastName = "Smith")
x$firstname
```

## Lack of illogical error messages 

```{r}
x <- data.frame("names" = c(1,2), "bodies" = c(1,2))
x$bodys
```

## Lack of illogical error messages

```{r}
x <- c(1, 2)
y <- c(3, 4, 5, 6)
cbind(x, y)
```
